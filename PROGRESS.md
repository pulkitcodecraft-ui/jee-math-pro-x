# Project Progress

## Phase 0 — Project Setup ✅
**Date:** 2026-06-18

### What was done:
- Scaffolded Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (v4) project using `create-next-app`
- App Router enabled, `src/` directory structure
- Firebase client SDK (v9+ modular) installed
- Firebase configuration with placeholder env vars (`.env.local.example`)
- Firebase services initialized (`src/lib/firebase/config.ts`) — Firestore, Auth, Storage
- Firestore data model types defined in `src/types/`:
  - `Topic` — with extensible `subject` field (Mathematics | Physics | Chemistry)
  - `Question` — with difficulty levels, approach references, mistakes/traps
  - `Approach` — with status workflow (official / pending / approved / rejected)
  - `User` — with role-based access (student / admin)
- AI client abstraction layer created (`src/lib/ai/aiClient.ts`):
  - `interpretSearchQuery()` — mocked, keyword-matching (Phase 4 integration point)
  - `explainSolution()` — mocked, generic template (Phase 5 integration point)
  - ⚠️ Both functions are **mocked** — real AI API to be plugged in later

## Phase 1 — Landing Page ✅
**Date:** 2026-06-18

### What was done:

- Design system: dark theme, glassmorphism, gradient utilities, Inter font, animations
- Navbar with glass effect on scroll, mobile hamburger menu, Login + Start Learning CTAs
- Hero section with gradient orbs, grid pattern, animated entrance, stats bar
- Features section: 6 cards (AI Search, Multiple Approaches, Mistakes/Traps, AI Explain, Community, PYQ)
- Topics Preview: 6 math topics with gradient icons, subtopic/question counts
- How It Works: 4-step workflow cards
- CTA section with gradient card background, dual action buttons
- Footer with logo, nav links, copyright
- All sections have IntersectionObserver scroll animations
- Login accessible via nav link, never forced on entry

### Files created/changed:
- `src/app/globals.css` (design system overhaul)
- `src/app/layout.tsx` (SEO metadata, Inter + JetBrains Mono fonts)
- `src/app/page.tsx` (landing page composition)
- `src/components/landing/Navbar.tsx`
- `src/components/landing/HeroSection.tsx`
- `src/components/landing/FeaturesSection.tsx`
- `src/components/landing/TopicsPreview.tsx`
- `src/components/landing/HowItWorks.tsx`
- `src/components/landing/CTASection.tsx`
- `src/components/landing/Footer.tsx`

## Phase 2 — Core Navigation & Topic Pages ✅
**Date:** 2026-06-18

### What was done:
- Built app shell with persistent AppNavbar (separate from landing page navbar)
- Route group `(app)` layout wraps all `/topics` pages
- Topic listing page (`/topics`) with 3 mock topics: Functions, Probability, Coordinate Geometry
- Individual topic pages (`/topics/[topicId]`) with:
  - Breadcrumb navigation
  - Topic header with gradient icon, description, subtopic pills
  - Tabbed content: Overview, Practice Questions, Previous Year Questions, Resources
  - Overview tab: Theory & Notes, Common Mistakes, Common Traps sections + sidebar with Quick Stats and Recent Questions
  - Questions tab: clickable list with difficulty badges and approach/mistake counts
  - PYQ tab: placeholder with year badges
  - Resources tab: 4 resource category cards
- Mock data layer (`src/lib/data/mockData.ts`): 3 topics, 6 questions, 5 approaches with helper functions
- `generateStaticParams` for SSG of all topic pages

### Files created/changed:
- `src/lib/data/mockData.ts`
- `src/components/app/AppNavbar.tsx`
- `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`
- `src/app/(app)/topics/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(app)/topics/[topicId]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(app)/topics/[topicId]/TopicTabs.tsx`

## Phase 3 — Question Page Structure ✅
**Date:** 2026-06-18

### What was done:
- Built individual question page template (`/topics/[topicId]/questions/[questionId]`)
- Added breadcrumb navigation back to topics and specific topic
- Created question header with difficulty and subtopic badges
- Implemented `QuestionContent` client component with tabbed approaches
- Built "Smartest Method" highlighting with glowing gradient effects
- Added collapsible "Common Mistakes" and "Common Traps" sections
- Integrated with `generateStaticParams` for static site generation of all mock questions

### Files created/changed:
- `src/app/(app)/topics/[topicId]/questions/[questionId]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(app)/topics/[topicId]/questions/[questionId]/QuestionContent.tsx`

## Phase 4 — AI-Powered Search Bar (Mocked) ✅
**Date:** 2026-06-18

### What was done:
- Built `SearchBar` component (`src/components/search/SearchBar.tsx`) wired to `interpretSearchQuery()` from the AI client
- Full search UX: text input with clear button, loading skeleton, results panel with clickable subtopic pills, view-all link
- Keyboard shortcuts: Enter to search, Escape to clear
- Clicking a subtopic option routes to the matching `/topics/{topicId}` page
- General-fallback case (unrecognised query) shows the three main topics as clickable options
- Embedded SearchBar in the Hero section of the landing page — sits between the subheadline and the secondary CTAs, making AI search the **primary action**

### ⚠️ AI Integration Point
`interpretSearchQuery()` in `src/lib/ai/aiClient.ts` is **still mocked** (500 ms fake delay + keyword matching).
To wire a real AI API: replace only the function body in `aiClient.ts`. The `SearchBar` component, types, and all other UI are unchanged.

### Files created/changed:
- `src/components/search/SearchBar.tsx` ← new
- `src/components/landing/HeroSection.tsx` ← added SearchBar import + embed

## Phase 5 — AI Step-by-Step Explanation Tool (Mocked) ✅
**Date:** 2026-06-18

### What was done:
- Built `/explain` page (`src/app/(app)/explain/page.tsx`) inside the app shell, with header + intro
- Built `ExplainTool` client component (`src/app/(app)/explain/ExplainTool.tsx`):
  - Two-panel layout — left: Question + Solution textareas; right: explanation output
  - "Load sample" button pre-fills a real JEE question/solution; "Clear" resets the form
  - "Explain Step by Step" button calls `explainSolution(question, solution)` from the AI client
  - Empty state, animated loading skeleton, and a numbered step-by-step result with a "Key Takeaway" summary card
  - Submit disabled until both fields are filled
- Added "AI Explain" link to the app navbar (`src/components/app/AppNavbar.tsx`) — desktop + mobile

### ⚠️ AI Integration Point
`explainSolution()` in `src/lib/ai/aiClient.ts` is **still mocked** (800 ms fake delay + generic template steps).
To wire a real AI API: replace only the function body in `aiClient.ts`. The `ExplainTool` component, types, and all other UI are unchanged.

### Files created/changed:
- `src/app/(app)/explain/page.tsx` ← new
- `src/app/(app)/explain/ExplainTool.tsx` ← new
- `src/components/app/AppNavbar.tsx` ← added AI Explain nav link

## Phase 6 — Authentication (Firebase Auth) ✅
**Date:** 2026-06-18

### What was done:
- **Auth state management decision:** used React Context (`AuthProvider` + `useAuth()` hook) — the idiomatic Firebase + Next.js App Router pattern.
- Built auth service (`src/lib/auth/authService.ts`):
  - `signUp` (email/password) → creates Firebase Auth user + sets `displayName` + creates Firestore `users/{uid}` profile doc with `role: 'student'` default
  - `signIn`, `signOut`, `getUserProfile`
  - `friendlyAuthError()` maps Firebase error codes to readable messages
  - `isFirebaseConfigured` flag — false until real keys are added, so the app never crashes in logged-out/demo mode
- Built `AuthProvider` (`src/lib/auth/AuthContext.tsx`): subscribes to `onAuthStateChanged`, loads the Firestore profile (incl. role), exposes `firebaseUser`, `profile`, `loading`, `isConfigured`, and the auth actions. Skips the listener gracefully when not configured.
- Wrapped the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) with `<AuthProvider>`.
- **Login/Signup page** (`/login`): single page with login↔signup toggle, `?mode=signup` and `?next=` support, Suspense-wrapped (for `useSearchParams`), error display, and a clear "not configured" notice. Redirects logged-in users away.
- **Profile page** (`/profile`, inside `(app)` shell): protected route (redirects logged-out users to `/login?next=/profile`), shows display name, email, role badge, member-since, an admin shortcut for admins, and a sign-out button.
- **Auth-aware navbar** (`src/components/app/AppNavbar.tsx`): shows an avatar + dropdown (Profile / Admin / Sign out) when logged in, or Log in / Sign up links when logged out.
- Recreated `.env.local.example` (was lost in the IDE switch) with all 6 Firebase placeholder vars.

### ⚠️ Setup needed before auth works
Login/signup are fully built but require **real Firebase keys**. Copy `.env.local.example` → `.env.local`, fill in your Firebase project's web config, and enable **Email/Password** sign-in in the Firebase console. Until then the UI shows a friendly "not configured" message and the app runs in logged-out browsing mode.

> Admin role: new accounts default to `student`. To make a user an admin, set their `role` field to `"admin"` in the Firestore `users` collection (admin dashboard UI comes in Phase 7).

### Files created/changed:
- `.env.local.example` ← recreated
- `src/lib/auth/authService.ts` ← new
- `src/lib/auth/AuthContext.tsx` ← new
- `src/lib/auth/index.ts` ← new
- `src/app/layout.tsx` ← wrapped with AuthProvider
- `src/app/login/page.tsx` ← new
- `src/app/(app)/profile/page.tsx` ← new
- `src/components/app/AppNavbar.tsx` ← auth-aware (user menu + logout)

## Phase 7 � Community Approach Submission + Admin Review ?
**Date:** 2026-06-19

### What was done:
- Built `approachService.ts` for handling approach submissions and admin reviews using Firebase Firestore and Storage.
- Implemented `SubmitApproachForm.tsx` to let logged-in students submit new approaches (with optional image uploads up to 5MB).
- Integrated `SubmitApproachForm` into the question page UI, complete with login prompts for unauthenticated users.
- Created `/admin` dashboard protected route for admins to review, approve, or reject pending community approaches.
- Fixed TypeScript type resolution issues related to Firebase SDK modules by removing problematic ambient declarations and ensuring explicit typing.

### Files created/changed:
- `src/lib/approaches/approachService.ts`
- `src/lib/approaches/index.ts`
- `src/components/approach/SubmitApproachForm.tsx`
- `src/app/(app)/admin/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(app)/topics/[topicId]/questions/[questionId]/QuestionContent.tsx`
- `src/firebase-modules.d.ts` (removed)

## Phase 8 � Polish & Review ?
**Date:** 2026-06-19

### What was done:
- Performed an end-to-end review of the user journey from Landing Page to Admin Dashboard.
- Ensured the UI uses consistent premium styling (gradients, glassmorphism, micro-animations).
- Verified graceful degradation (the app functions perfectly in a logged-out demo state when Firebase keys are missing).
- Created a final walkthrough report detailing exactly which features are real (Firebase) vs which are mocked (AI features).

### Files created/changed:
- `walkthrough.md` (Final artifact)
  
## Phase 7 Rebuilt (Cursor)  
Rebuilt approach service, submit form, admin dashboard, Google sign-in + blank-page fix.  
Files: src/lib/firebase/approachService.ts, src/components/question/SubmitApproach.tsx, src/app/(app)/admin/*, QuestionContent.tsx, login/page.tsx, authService.ts, AuthContext.tsx 
  
## Phase 8 Polish (Cursor) - UI/UX trust + premium pass  
Removed fabricated stats/counts/social-proof; real derived numbers via getPlatformStats(). New premium Logo, real footer + About/Contact/Privacy pages. prefers-reduced-motion + no-JS reveal. Filled worked approaches for all 6 questions. Replaced emoji with SVG. Build green, 21 routes.
